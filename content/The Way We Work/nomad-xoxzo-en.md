We, team Xoxzo, are the creator of the APIs you use. 


Read on to get to know us (https://info.xoxzo.com/en/aboutus/) a little more.

### Service offered completely online
Xoxzo APIs are offered on an online self-serviced platform. 
For efficient management, we aim for online presence and digitization ultimately. 
However, always _respecting that **users at both ends of the line and team Xoxzo are human beinsg** 
with blood_ the team respects our clients and strives to provide satisfactory services on a daily basis.


### 100% Remote Work
Since the beginning when the predecessor Marimore (Marimore) was founded in December 2009, 
the team has always been "nomad" workers. 
**We are a company practicing 100% remote work. **
Even on weekdays morning at 9 o'clock, no one will come to work, 
instead start working at their favorite places, possibly without ever stepping out of the house. 
No commuting torture, no time used for commuting. Even if you feel snappy on that day or are in your pajamas all day, it is perfectly OK!


### ALL hands assembly?
Companies with offices may start Monday mornings with a company-wide morning assembly. 
Members of Team Xoxzo do not all live within Japan. 
Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, The Philippines, India and Russia are where are members reside, 
so the Monday meeting is usually held in the afternoon by Japanese time that corresponds to 
the early morning hours of Russia. 
Please refer to [the tools used by team Xoxzo](Https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2017/10/12/tools-of-our-trade/) 
for those meetings and usual communication, if you would.

### Let's have a break!!
"Just a break" Coffee and sweets at 10 or 15 o'clock, 
we will do it at each time in each country. 
Lunch break is also disjointed and alone. 
However, team Xoxzo regardless of country borders, time difference, age, gender, title, 
meet at **Watercooler-chat (a bit chatting at the vending machines)** 
and/or **Girl's-chat (female employee's enjoyment)** and we are all very close friends. 
We all fully utilize the tools to connect with each other and use them for work as if they are part of ourselves.

### Travelling? (as Japanese companies usually do)
Ah, company trips? do you want to know?
A part of them can be viewed [here](https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2017/03/01/we-are-ten-years-old/).

### Friendship with your colleagues
Certainly, there are variations in the finishing hours as well, 
so we do not always have relationships like _"How about having some drinks on our way home?"_
However, if we find members who work online even in the middle of the night, 
we can talk to them personally and enjoy the private conversation in a different angle from usual meetings 
and deepen our friendship that breaks down the barrier of the physical distance. Even on a rainy day or a cold evening, 
after talking with our colleagues in our pajamas with our favorite liquor in hand, we can go straight to bed without walking home!

### Switch your work and private life or escape at anytime, anywhere
You can work anywhere in the world, whether on a short trip or a long trip, with power and online connection. 
A snap, and when we close the laptop, we can be soaked in a hot spring tonight ... 
we can swim in the pool of luxury hotels ... or in reality, go straight to supermarkets for dinner preparation, 
or picking up our children! All is possible without commuting.


... This is the way Xoxzo operates.
The momentum of remote working is getting stronger in Japan.
_"Want to go for it!" "We are already started!"_
If you have such notions, please let us know. Team Xoxzo is looking forward to hearing from you.

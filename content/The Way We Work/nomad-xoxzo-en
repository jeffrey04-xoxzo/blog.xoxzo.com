We, Team Xoxzo, the operators of the APIs you use. Firstly, did you know how to pronounce our name?


It is **"Zokuzo"**.

Please let us introduce about the team Xoxzo (https://info.xoxzo.com/en/aboutus/) just a little.

### Service offered completely online
Xoxzo APIs are offered on a complete online self-service. 
For an efficient management, we aim for online and digitization ultimately. 
However, always _respecting that **users at both ends of the line and team Xoxzo are human being** 
with blood_ and respects and strives to provide satisfactory services on a daily basis.


### 100% Remote Work
Since the beginning when the predecessor Marimore (Marimore) was founded in December 2009, 
the team is always "Nomad" style. 
**We are the company practicing 100% remote work. **
Even at weekdays morning at 9 o'clock, no one will come to work, 
instead start working in their favorite places without any needs of going out the door. 
No commuting hell, no time used for commuting. Even if you are snappy or pajamas all day, it is perfectly OK!?


### ALL hands assembly?
Companies with their offices may start Monday mornings with a whole body meeting. 
As members of Team Xoxzo does not live limited to Japan. 
Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Russia are the residential countries, 
so the whole meeting usually is held in the afternoon of Japanese time that is according to 
the early morning hours of Russia. 
Please refer to [the tools used by team Xoxzo](Https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/2017/10/12/tools-of-our-trade/) 
for those meetings and usual communication, if you would.

### Let's have a break!!
"Just a break" Coffee and sweets at ten or 15 o'clock, 
we will do it at each time in each country. 
Lunch break is also disjointed and alone. 
However, team Xoxzo who crossed the country borders, time difference, age, gender, title, 
meet at **Watercooler-chat (a bit chatting at the vending machines)** 
and/or **Girl's-chat (female employee's enjoyment)** and we are all very close friends. 
We all fully utilize the tools to connect each other and use them for work as if they are part of ourselves.

### Travelling? (as Japanese companies usually do)
Ah, company trips? do you want to know?
A part of them can be viewed from here. (Https://blog.xoxzo.com/en/the-way-we-work/)

### friendship with your colleagues
Certainly, there are variations in the finishing hours as well, 
so we do not always have relationships like _"How about having some drinks on our way home?"_
However, if you find members who work online even in the middle of the night, 
you can talk to them personally and enjoy the private conversation different from usual meetings 
and deepen your friendship that makes you not feeling the physical distance. Even on a rainy day or a cold evening, 
after talking with the own favorite liquor in each pajamas you can go straight to bed without walking home!

### Switch your work and private life or escape at anytime, anywhere
You can work anywhere in the world, whether on a short trip or a long trip, with power and online connection. 
A snap, and when we close the laptop, we can be soaked in a hot spring tonight ... 
we can swim in the pool of luxury hotels ... or in reality, go straight to supermarkets for dinner preparation, 
picking up your children! All possible without commuting.


... In such an environment, Xoxzo operates.
Remote work in Japan where momentum gets stronger, 
_"Want to go for it!" "We are already started!"_
If you have such a voice, please let us know. Team Xoxzo is looking forward to hearing.

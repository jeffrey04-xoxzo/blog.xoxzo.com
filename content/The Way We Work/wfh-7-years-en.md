I am a sole parent withh two children.

It was seven years ago when I came back to Kyoto from Melbourne, after living there for 15 years. 
[Only 28% of Smart phone users](https://consult.nikkeibp.co.jp/info/news/2013/0830sp/) that time, 
myself didn't really know the word of `Work-from-home` but `SOHO`.

In that society, I decided to do `SOHO` to live on. 
Because I thought of:

 **working from home saves**
1. time for getting ready to commute
2. time for commute
3. time for taking unnecessary break 
4. cost for cosmetics and clothes for outing
5. cost for lunches to buy outside

I wanted to use the time I save by `SOHO` to spend with my children.
I wanted to save up the cost I save by `SOHO` for the future education of my children.
Yes, all for my children.

I had 2 x desktop PC, 1 x laptop, 1 x smart phone and 2 ipads that time. 
So I bought just a multi-task printer and L-shaped large desk to set up my _Small Office_.

I struggled for the first 3 months with single tasks I got from online-job platforms, then when I started to wonder
whether I should continue `SOHO` or better to go physically out to search the job, finally got 2 regular jobs.
I decided to go on. 

The first year went only with trials & errors. 
But it wasn't completely wasting as I learned from those errors a lot.
In the second year, I got more jobs and switching between jobs was my problem.
But I found that I love working, and I love working-from-home.

I managed to organizing jobs better in the third year, and I became better to select the jobs that suit me and my lifestyle in the fourth year.
During this period, while I was still a kind of struggle to juggle my jobs, I had a feeling that work-from-home is my style.
There were increasing needs of online workers too. I bought my first Macbook and that became my tresure.

The fifth year started with a good news that one of the work put me in the permanent position.
My work with the company went more in the amount and deeper and wider in quality. 
At the same time, I found myself sat in one position for most of the day with Macbook on my lap. 
My work needs not such a large L-shaped desk any longer, 
on contrarily to my first imagination at the start of `SOHO` work.

Now we come to 2020.

Summary: A summary of my Work-From-Home days

I am a sole parent withh two children.

It was seven years ago when I came back to Kyoto from Melbourne, after living there for 15 years. 
[Only 28% of Smart phone users](https://consult.nikkeibp.co.jp/info/news/2013/0830sp/) are in Japan that time, 
myself didn't really use the word of `Work-from-home` but `SOHO`.

What images I had in `SOHO` that time were **Working-From-Home SAVES!**

What can we save?

I thought:
1. time for getting ready to commute
2. time for commute
3. time for taking unnecessary break 
4. cost for cosmetics and clothes for outing
5. cost for lunches to buy outside...

### What did I prepare?

I already had 2 x desktop PC, 1 x laptop, 1 x smart phone and 2 ipads that time. 
So I bought just a multi-task printer and a L-shaped large desk to set up my _Small Office, Home Office_.

### 1st year

I struggled for the first 3 months working on single tasks I got from online-job platforms, then when I started to wonder
whether I should continue `SOHO` or better to go physically out to search the job, finally got 2 regular jobs.
I decided to go on with `SOHO`. 

But of course, the first year went only with trials & errors. 
It wasn't completely wasting as I learned a lot from those.

### 2nd year

In the following year, I got more jobs but another problem arose. Switching between jobs was my problem, many on-going jobs stayed on my shoulders at all the time. I worked all the time, except the time when children are at home. Day and Night and over the weekend.

The life was hard but I found that I love working, and I love working-from-home.

### the next step

I managed to organizing jobs better in the third year, and I became better to pick the jobs that suit me and my lifestyle in the fourth year.

During this period, while I was still a kind of struggle to juggle my jobs, I had a feeling that Work-From-Home is my style.
As I imagined **Working-From-Home would save**, I managed to work to support my small family as well as attending school events and sending the children for the after school activities.

There were increasing needs of online workers too. I bought my first Macbook and that became my tresure.

### work as a remote worker

The fifth year started with a good news that one of the work put me in the permanent position.
It was quite a new concept in me, _a permanent position as 100% remote work_. I didn't feel anything strange, the work style just fit me perfectly. Only I didn't see the other samples around.

My work went more in the amount and deeper and wider in quality. 
By this time, I no longer use my L-shaped desk that I prepared for my `SOHO` work, I just sit in a lounge room sofa with a laptop.

In this few years of time, my work setup is changed from _the desktop on the large L-shaped desk_ to _the laptop on the sofa-sitting in the lounge_ and my work is changed from _cloud-tasks_ to _permanent work at remote_.   

### Now we come to 2020 pandemic

It has been such a hard period to watch any covid-19 news of any part of the world so far since the start of 2020. 

The people who were suffered with this desease, the people who work to cure them, the people who work to support our daily life from every direction, the people who unfortunately lost their jobs or got reduced income and the people who started to work remotely.

Although it is hard to focus on my work due to the stay-home children, we stay in good health and have work with stable income as nothing on my work has changed. I kept `Work-From-Home` (was used to be `SOHO`) for 7 years already and now I am an expert. I am happy and lucky that I work this way, and will continue Working-From-Home, as long as I can.

P.S. My child didn't allow me to dump the L-shaped desk. It is sitting in her room happily ever after.

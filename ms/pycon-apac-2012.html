    <p>PyCon APAC 2012 that was held on June 7th - 9th is over. Attended by all
kinds of people from many parts of the world. It was a lovely and an eye
opening experience.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://xoxzoblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/ff4e8-6a0153916e707f970b0167676601ea970b-pi.jpg"><img alt="IMG00356" src="https://xoxzoblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/ff4e8-6a0153916e707f970b0167676601ea970b-pi.jpg" title="IMG00356" />{.asset

Marimore team attended the conference and gave a few talk (lightning
talk included) on various topics. Kamal gave a talk titled Python/Django
for PHP Developers which cause quite a stir among the attendees as two
language should never be discussed in the same room.</p>
<p>I gave a brief talk on HTML5 Polyfills. It is my first talk to a public
audience accompanied by some difficulties with LibreOffice Impress
(which does not seem to want to maximize to full screen). Nevertheless
its quite an experience and there will always be a room for
improvement. </p>

of the talks are great, but a few that really interest me is Diversity
as a Dependency (Anna Ravenscroft), Relational Database Access with
Python 'sans' ORM (Mark Rees). I've attended Mr Rees's talk on several
occasions, <a href="http://blog.mosc.my/2009/06/testing-web-apps-with-scripting.html">MOSC
2009</a>
 and other MyOSS Meetup at Technology Park Malaysia, he's an excellent
speaker and the topic he presents is kind of refreshing in a world where
framework is abundant, going back to its roots, Python DB API. Diversity
as a Dependency touched on a lot of psychological phenomenon on what
makes a group of people outstanding. The barriers that we face in
working as a group such as groupthink, conformity, anchoring and many
more are mentioned and explained in detail by the speaker, Anna
Ravenscroft.</p>
<p>Overall the talks are great especially the keynotes, the food is nice
and to top it off, the programming tournament is something that I have
never experienced, as I have never been good at a very time constrained
programming challenge, it was tough, me and several others only managed
to solve 1 question in 10 minutes (1st place answers all 10 questions in
that amount of time). </p>
<p>Hopefully on the next PyCon, it could be better with more interesting
topics and speakers, and more food delicious food of course.</p>
